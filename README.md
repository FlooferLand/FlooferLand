_hoi am Floof!_ <sub><sup>_(She/They)_</sup></sub> <br/>
I attempt to make FOSS tools to help people (๑꧆◡꧆๑) <br/>

Favourite IDEs: `VSCode` && `Intellij` <br/>
Favourite OS: `Arch (EndeavourOS)`, `Fedora`, and `Debian` <br/>
Current OS: `Windows 11`  *(Forced to use it because of software and hardware compatibility ;-;)*

## Stands for:
  1. Basic human rights _(duh)_ - Many people get critiqued, bullied, and made fun of for absolutely no reason. People of a different skin color, people who weren't born to look like their gender, people of a different sexual orientation. People are people and unless they've hurt someone or something, because it's dumb to make fun of people because of things they can't change.

  2. Libre/free software - Free as in freedom, not in price. I believe proprietary software is a serious threat as using it you are fully relying on the creators of the software for bug fixes, security patches, adding of features, and the creators of the software can collect any data they want from you, such as taking a screenshot of your screen every minute and sending it to a private server of theirs for some malicious purpose. The majority of people would never know if a proprietary program is doing something malicious unless they decompiled it and scanned the network requests the software sends. <br/> Libre (FOSS) software also allows you to modify, distribute, and use the software for any reason. In case a piece of software is abandoned it allows the community to continue development as if nothing happened. In case the community wants a feature implemented they can also just implement it themselves.

## Favourite languages (from most favourite to least):
  1. Rust *(900 out of 10 but it sucks for game development rn)*
  1. C# & Java
  1. JavaScript / TypeScript
  1. Python
  1. C++
  1. Assembly *(will be learning sometime, as i want to make NES games!)*

## Idols, cool people, and cool foundations:
  1. Scott Cawthon - Creator of the FNaF franchise, donated about over a million dollars to charities from the money he gained from FNaF. A big idol of mine when it comes to game development as well.

  2. Mr Beast - Doing his best to save the world and help people. [According to penguinz0 / moistcr1tikal, Mr Beast is even nicer irl than he is in his videos](https://youtube.com/watch?v=yu1AurtSL18?t=75). He has a whole warehouse full of food and supplies to give to people around the area who can't afford those things, and he never talked about it in a video.

  3. The GNU project and RMS - They are trying their best to point people to claiming back their privacy and security by pointing them to using libre _(free-as-in-freedom)_ software. Stallman himself has gone trough a lot of drama, but he has undoubtedly brought a ton of light towards libre/FOSS software.
  
  4. Valve - While they have a form of in-website telemetry *(can be disabled)*, they don't seem to sell any of the data as they don't really have a reason to *(I've made a Python project specifically to calculate their net worth and it all seems to come from the Steam software and hardware sales, literal billions of dollars. Currently thinking of rewriting it in Rust and publishing it)*. <br/> They always try to push Linux and they always try to make software open-source whenever possible; They always opt out of using proprietary operating systems like Windows and Android *(Google's version)* for their hardware products, always opting to use Linux instead. They also heavily push gaming on Linux, making contributions to Wine and trying to make gaming on Linux just as good _(if not better)_ than on Windows.

## Wrong-ens:
  1. Facebook *(now called "Meta")* - While there are tiny parts of the Facebook corporation that aren't bad (the open-source sector specifically). The entire corporation is; They have purchased companies and have broken promises tons of times. For example when they bought Oculus they said they would never make users have to make a Facebook account to use their Oculus products, back in 2020 they made everyone require a Facebook account to use Oculus products. Another example is with Whatsapp. Whatsapp was made to be a secure and private way of communication, once Facebook bought it however they've introduced telemetry and have broken the promise of keeping the platform private.

  2. Canonical - While they aren't that bad they provide a lot of non-free software with Ubuntu and have messed up a few times in the past. They also seem to try and drown out Linux distributions other than their own but I'm not sure if that's an actual thing or not. <br/> They're no doubt better than Microsoft, but I wouldn't say they're clean in terms of trying to collect user data.
